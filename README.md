## Introduction

ANNs form the basic unit of deep learning and are a powerful tool in
predictive modeling, albeit not without pitfalls. In this workshop, you
willâ€¦

-   get an introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in R with
    Keras and TensorFlow
-   be working with conceptually understanding the inner workings of
    ANNs
-   touch upon the main pitfall of ANNs, model over-fitting

*The workshop assumes basic R/Data Science skills as well as knowledge
of rmarkdown and the RStudio IDE. Please note, the workshop is very
hands-on oriented, so expect to get your fingers dirty!*

## Getting started

Running `00_setup_workshop_packages.R` will setup the needed
environment.
